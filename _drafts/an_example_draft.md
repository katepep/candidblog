About blog

I'm an avid learner. My one constant goal in life is to become a better every single day, even just by a little. I'm also a recent college graduate which means that this is the first time where I don't have some looming authority forcing me to learn and improve (other than for my job :p). I quickly realized how different this new life is from educational life and I needed a space to learn from others and share what I have learnt. This is my attempt at creating a space to share what I have learnt in hope that it might help others.

I started this blog with a goal of bringing value to the readers' lives. The two areas where I think I can share my knowledge and actually benefit others are in technology and how to manage life from the perspective of a new graduate. So I decided to call this blog Candid Tech Life. I'll try to be as straightforward and helpful as I can.



In starting this blog, I had no specific topics that I would write about. I just knew that there must be new college grads like me who would be going through the same things I was and needed a place where I can share some of what I have learnt. But I know my interests. I'm constantly trying to become a better version of myself and I love technology. So I decided to call this blog Candid Tech Life. We will look at technology from both a consumer perspective and a developer a perspective. And in parallel to this, we will consider life from the perspective of a new graduate.

Ultimately, I want this blog to bring value to your life. I want this to be meaningful and hope that you can take away lessons or values that you can apply to be the best version of yourself.  

freedom with structure!
Personally, college was one of the best times in my life so far. My favorite part, the freedom to pursue any field my college offered. At least that is what I thought in the beginning. But now, having been a "real world" adult for a while I realize why I loved college. It provided me with freedom as well as structure to help me constantly move forward. As a full-time employee, I realize how incredible this concept is.

College was freedom with structure. I constantly thought about my future and I had the resources to do it. You always kept moving forward and if something wasn't working you could switch.

Its hard to switch in real life. I think you have the freedom to do anything you want but it will take a much longer time to be successful.

structuring life so you are always moving forward and constantly adjusting path.  

1. Podcasts I like as a blog
2. Python Scraping (make sure to use a website that is opensource or I can make my own webpage for this :p )
3. Setting up Google Cloud Platform
4. Ask people how helpful Kaggle is for them to learn machine learning. Let them know that I find it useful to look at other people's work and learn from them.

5. Bi-weekly favorite podcasts (as in episode).
